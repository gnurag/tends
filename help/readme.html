<blockquote>
    The Java&nbsp;2 SDK is intended for use on Windows 95, Windows 98, 
    Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000 operating systems running 
    on Intel hardware, with the following additional requirements and 
    recommendations:
<p><blockquote>
     A Pentium 166MHz or faster processor.  At least 
    32 megabytes of physical RAM is required to run GUI applications. 
    Forty-eight megabytes is recommended for applets running within a 
    browser using the Java Plug-in product. Running with less memory may 
    cause disk swapping which has a severe effect on performance. Very 
    large programs may require more RAM for adequate performance. 
</blockquote>

<p>You should have 65 megabytes of free disk space before
attempting to install the Java 2 SDK software. If you also install the 
separate documentation download bundle, you need an additional 120 megabytes 
of free disk space.

<a name="install"><h2>Installation</a></h2><h2><a name=compatibility>Compatibility</h2></a>
<blockquote>

<p>
See the Java Software web site 
for the list of known compatibility issues. Every effort has been made to 
support programs written for previous version of the Java platform. 
Although some 
incompatible changes were necessary, most software should migrate to 
current version with no reprogramming.  Any failure to do so is 
considered a bug, except for a small number of cases where compatibility 
was deliberately broken, as described on our compatibility page. Some
compatibility-breaking changes were required to close potential
security holes or to fix implementation or design bugs.
